# TechToolkit
Toolkit written in VB to help clean and tuneup windows based machines
I originally created this toolkit to helpe my at a Remote Helpdesk position a few years back. 
The toolkit was written using visual basic 2008 express and has been updated using visual studio express 2013 for windows desktop. 
My goal is to have the toolkit run with .net framework 4.0 and higher and work on winodws 7,8,and 10 pc's remotely.
